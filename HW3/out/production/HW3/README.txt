General Explanation:
	The source codes are saved in two packages under the src file as PartOne and PartTwo.
	In the package PartOne, there are 4 java files representing four classes, Shape, Circle, Rectangle, Square.
	There are two files in the package PartTwo, ListOfNumbers.java and Exercise2.java.
	The cat and readList methods are in the ListOfNumbers.java file.
	I wrote some test data myself in data.txt and wrote the test code in the main method.
