Enviroment：
	System：win10
	Ide：Intellij IDEA
	JDK: jdk-12.0.1 or higher
General Explanation:
	The source codes are saved in two packages under the src file as PartOne and PartTwo.
	In the package PartOne, there are 4 java files representing four classes, Shape, Circle, Rectangle, Square.
	There are two files in the package PartTwo, ListOfNumbers.java and Exercise2.java.
	The cat and readList methods are in the ListOfNumbers.java file.
	I wrote some test data myself in data.txt and wrote the test code in the main method.
	As for the Matrix Problem, I define two constructors, 
		public Matrix(int n,int m) : constructor that creates a matrix of size nxm, with all values initially set to 0 
		public Matrix(Matrix m) : Constructing and assigning using a object of Matrix Class
	Based on the requirements I implemented the following methods : 
		void save(String filename) , Matrix sum(Matrix m) , Matrix product(Matrix m) 
	I wrote two read methods with different parameter lists:
		public static Matrix read(String filename) : Generate a matrix of corresponding dimensions based on the dimensions of the matrix data in the file
		public static Matrix read(int n, int m, String filename) : Matrix dimensions are preset, especially designed for ExceptionWrongMatrixDimension.
	Designed two methods to access the private property : public int getMatrix(int i, int j) , public void setMatrix(int i,int j, int val)
	Two new exceptions are defined : class ExceptionWrongMatrixValues extends RuntimeException , class ExceptionWrongMatrixDimension extends RuntimeException
